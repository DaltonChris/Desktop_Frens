- Desktop Fren, This is a quick silly project i made so I could animate my 'Brain-Slug' enemy from my game Ethereal Escape across my taskbar. 
- Some pretty average C# so i could add animated sprites that translate across my task bar for that ultimate microsoft experience
- I definitely love microsoft proprietary software

## A Windows Presentation Foundation APP to translate & Animate sprite frames on a Windows desktop

- C# - code
- Is hidden in the taskbar - End task in Task manager to close your fren (he uses like 60mb of ram u can spare it surely)
- Aseprite - Sprite art (sprites not kept in repo, add your file paths to the var's in "MainWindow.xaml.cs")
- Dope slug frend on the task bar, whats not to love
- Do as you please with this.
